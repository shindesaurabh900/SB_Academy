    <p class="firstpara"><strong>What is C++</strong>
        C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.<br>
        C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br>

        C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.<br>

        The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.<br><br>

        <strong>Why Use C+</strong><br>
        C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.<br>

        C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.<br>

        C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be<br>
        reused, lowering development costs<br>.

        C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.<br>

        C++ is fun and easy to learn!<br>

        As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa<br>
